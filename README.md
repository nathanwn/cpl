# CPL

![build](https://github.com/nathan-wien/cpl/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

CPL stands for **C**ompetitive **P**rogramming **L**ibrary.

The main purpose of this project is to properly maintain various implementations of algorithms and data structures, mostly for personal competitive programming purposes.

I created this project in order to practice C++. These days I no longer do competitive programming seriously.
