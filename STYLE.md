# Coding Style

This is according to my personal preferences, which can be (partly) enforced with `clang-format`.

## Naming

* Variables and function names should be in `snake_case`.
* Type names and class names should be in `UpperCamelCase`.
* File names should be in `snake_case`.

## Indentation

4 spaces.
